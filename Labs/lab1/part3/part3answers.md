Q1: Yes we can use 2 components. If we can add the variance to 1, we know that can use 2 comps.

Q2: Plotting C1 and C3, there is still separation in the plot, but we introduce some overlapping of data. Plotting C2 and C3 we have alot of overlapping, where the data is simular. Combining C1 and C2 results in a very clear separation.
There is no "new" information that C3 provides us, Its only creating noice.

Q3: Can you tell which feature contribute more towards the 1st PC?
Threee features: most concavity, mean concave points, and worst concave points (the ones closest to being yellow).
